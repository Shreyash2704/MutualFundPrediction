Here's an example of how to calculate the Sharpe Ratio for daily NAV data:

1.Calculate the daily returns of the mutual fund by taking the difference between the current day's NAV and 
the previous day's NAV, and dividing it by the previous day's NAV.

2.Calculate the average daily return over a specific period, such as a year, by adding up all the daily returns 
and dividing by the number of days.

3.Calculate the risk-free rate using a similar method as for the annualized average return, but using the daily yields 
of a Treasury bill or note with a similar maturity as the investment period of the fund.

4.Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns using the formula:

Standard deviation = square root of [sum of (daily return - average daily return)^2 / (number of days - 1)]

Finally, calculate the Sharpe Ratio using the same formula as before:

Sharpe Ratio = (average daily return - risk-free rate) / standard deviation


Sbi-contra-funds-direct-plan-growth
Risk free MF = (6.57+14.41) %
Equity = 79.02%

UTI Flexi Cap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth
Risk free MF = (0.16+4.15)%
Equity = 95.69%
